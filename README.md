# AIGaming
Working on a good bot to play the match game on aigaming.com

Not perfect yet, but should reach several thousend Points each game. 
Tries to handle the not uncommon case if a word is not recognised by the Azure API.

The bot is first analyzing all tiles, so not getting any points for the first 18 rounds:
